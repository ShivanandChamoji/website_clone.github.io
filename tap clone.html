When I joined actually I don't know much about programming, it was really hard time in my first month but after that a gradual increase in my programming knowledge I have seen inside me. I tried constantly to gain knowledge and all the faculty in the Tap Academy provided us best knowledge majorly in java Rohit sir and Megha ma'am . Now I'm very happy that my programming background is good . The way of teaching and knowledge gave by Rohit sir I could not forget in my life time , tq Rohit Sir and Megha ma'am.</p>

So from my point of view if anyone asks me about the TapAcademy, I will definitely suggest for this course because it's worthy. And it really helped me a lot. Thank you Mam, and thanks for the TapAcademy, because it helped me a lot and in future I will not only gain a job but I am confident that I will sustain in that job tooo Mam, and this is a basic pillar to me Mam.
